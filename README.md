# Scotland Yard
A recreation of the boardgame intended for local play on multiple smartphones powered by [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org) & [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com).

## Motivation
Scotland Yard has no playable online version, the [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ravensburgerdigital.scotlandyardmaster) contains only AR for the boardgame, and [Tabletop Simulator](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=286160&searchtext=Scotland+Yard) is not really usable on smartphones.

## Trademark
I have no affiliation with any of the trademark owners:
- [New Scotland Yard](https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00002192310) in the UK
- [Ravensburger](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=73531250&caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&caseType=DEFAULT&searchType=statusSearch) in the US
This repo does not use or host any original assets from the boardgame. This also is not indented as a commercial product - everything is open source and will be hosted on a free Github Page once its finished.
